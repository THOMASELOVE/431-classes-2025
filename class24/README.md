    - Five of our favorite responses to Task 5 in Lab 6 [are available here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nWHVGxKsVcw73PjdPYBPzq2aLXx7G9lM_HNK-4xvh-E/edit?usp=sharing).
    - If you want me to regrade any Lab, then fill out the [Lab Regrade Request Form](https://bit.ly/431-2025-lab-regrade-request). While the (optional) form is due 2025-12-10 at noon, I'd really like to get those done in the next day or so if possible.

    - Two students did select [the same song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqXyTNKlwTI&list=PL1WkTI58HjciC-FdKZkwiVet-Iar6u7wm&index=2), from all of the songs in the universe.

6. Speaking of extra credit opportunities, two remain active after today's class. One was described in a recent README, and the other in Quiz 2. Act quickly.

## Project B Presentations

The [Project B Presentation Schedule is here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-classes-2025/blob/main/projectB/schedule.md).

## Dealing with Missing Data in Project B

- In Project B, study 1: for each analysis, filter to complete cases on the variables used in that individual analysis.
- In Project B, study 2: filter to complete cases on your outcome and key predictor, then single imputation on all other predictors to determine final model choice, then (ideally) show multiple imputation results (`model_parameters()` and `glance()` are sufficient) across all of the data.
