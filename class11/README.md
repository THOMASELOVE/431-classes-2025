## Announcements

2. [Lab 3](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-labs-2025/tree/main/lab3) is also due Wednesday 2025-10-08 at noon.
3. I fixed the [Class 10 slides, Word and Quarto files](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-classes-2025/tree/main/class10#todays-slides) to correct the sample size (*n* = 847, not 846) after dropping cases with missing data.
4. By class time, you will have our feedback on your [Project A Plan](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectA-2025/plan.html).
    - We will visit [this page of examples and other feedback](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-classes-2025/blob/main/projectA/plans/examples.md) in class today, along with [this list of Project A Plans](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-classes-2025/blob/main/projectA/plans/README.md).
    - If Dr. Love asked you to **REDO** your Plan, then that revision is due to Canvas at **10 AM on Friday 2025-10-10**.
    - If Dr. Love has **ACCEPTED** your Plan, then you should get to work on the [Analyses](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectA-2025/analyses.html) and [Portfolio](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectA-2025/portfolio.html) while, of course, incorporating our comments about your Plan in the feedback you received via email on Monday 2025-10-06.
    - The following students had problems with the variables they selected, and I sent them an additional email about this today. Please make sure you review that email. Rules on what variables you can use, and in what analyses [remain here](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectA-2025/data.html#variables-for-each-analysis).
        - Isabela Drumond Fonseca and Renu Jadhav (change Analysis 1 predictor, and Analysis 2 and 3 outcomes)

        - Noha Orabi (change Analysis 1 predictor)

## [Love-431.R script](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-data/blob/main/data/Love-431.R) functions

Additional discussion and demonstration of two functions from [the `Love-431.R` script](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-data/blob/main/data/Love-431.R) that we'll introduce today [can be found here](scripts.md). The functions are called `twobytwo()` and `saifs_ci()`.

## Introducing the "Favorite Movies" activity for Class 12 (Thursday)

We'll spend a few moments today introducing [this breakout activity about the "favorite movies" data](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-classes-2025/blob/main/movies/class12.md), which we will actually do this Thursday, 2025-10-09, as part of Class 12.

## Reminders

1. By today, we hope you've completed [all of the readings assigned in September](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2025/calendar.html#september), as well as Spiegelhalter Chapter 8. Please read Chapter 9 in time for class next Tuesday 2025-10-14, and we'll also be reading Chapters 10 and 11 by the end of October.
2. [Lab 4](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-labs-2025/tree/main/lab4) is due at noon next Wednesday 2025-10-15, and there will also be a minute paper due that day.
3. You will receive [Quiz 1](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-quizzes-2025/blob/main/README.md) by 3 PM on Thursday 2025-10-16, and it is due Wednesday 2025-10-22 at noon.
4. Once your [Project A Plan](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectA-2025/plan.html) has been approved, you should be working on the [Project A Portfolio](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectA-2025/portfolio.html), due Wednesday 2025-10-29 at noon. In particular, you should be working on completing the [Project A Analyses](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectA-2025/analyses.html) now.
    - Those of you who were asked to complete a revision, submit it to [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu/) by 10 AM on Friday 2025-10-10.
5. If you need more to work on, it's always a good idea to complete [Lab X](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-labs-2025/tree/main/labX) earlier in the semester.
