## [Love-431.R script](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-data/blob/main/data/Love-431.R) functions

Additional discussion and demonstration of two functions from [the `Love-431.R` script](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-data/blob/main/data/Love-431.R) that we'll introduce today [is found here](scripts.md). The functions are called `twobytwo()` and `saifs_ci()`.

## Introducing the "Favorite Movies" activity for Class 12 (Thursday)

We'll spend a few moments today introducing [this breakout activity about the "favorite movies" data](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-classes-2025/blob/main/movies/class12.md), which we will execute on Thursday, 2025-10-09, as part of Class 12.

## Reminders

1. By today, we hope you've completed [all of the readings assigned in September](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2025/calendar.html#september), as well as Spiegelhalter Chapter 8. Please read Chapter 9 in time for class next Tuesday 2025-10-14, and we'll also be reading Chapters 10 and 11 by the end of October.
2. [Lab 4](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-labs-2025/tree/main/lab4) is due at noon next Wednesday 2025-10-15, and there will also be a minute paper due that day.
3. You will receive [Quiz 1](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-quizzes-2025/blob/main/README.md) by 3 PM on Thursday 2025-10-16, and it is due Wednesday 2025-10-22 at noon.
4. Once your [Project A Plan](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectA-2025/plan.html) has been approved, you should be working on the [Project A Portfolio](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectA-2025/portfolio.html), due Wednesday 2025-10-29 at noon. In particular, you should be working on completing the [Project A Analyses](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectA-2025/analyses.html) now.
5. If you need more to work on, it's always a good idea to complete [Lab X](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-labs-2025/tree/main/labX) earlier in the semester.
