## Excitement about course / Comfort with R

- Rows: How excited are you about taking a course in statistics and data science?
    - *1 = I have nightmares about this class. to 6 = I can't wait to get started.*
- Columns: How comfortable are you with R?
    - *1 = R? What is that? to 6 = I love R and use it all the time.*

R Comfort = | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | Sum
