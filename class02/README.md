## Today's Opener: The Quick Survey

As you come in, **please take** (from the box at the back table) a paper survey with 15 questions. Please read these instructions carefully before writing anything down.

1. Introduce yourself to someone near you.
2. Record the survey answers **for that other person**, while they record your responses.
3. Be sure to complete all 15 questions (both sides of the paper).
4. When you are finished, thank your partner and raise your hand. Someone will come around to collect your survey.

There is a [PDF copy of the Quick Survey here](431_surveyhandout_1perstudent_2025-09-04.pdf), if you'd like to look at the form after your paper copy has been collected.

## Today's Slides

Class | Date | Slides | Word .docx | Quarto .qmd | Recording
:---: | :--------: | :------: | :------: | :------: | :-------------:
02 | 2025-09-04 | **[Slides 02](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-slides-2025/class02.html)** | **[Word 02](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-slides-2025/class02w.docx)** | **[Code 02](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-slides-2025/blob/main/class02.qmd)** | Visit [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu/), select **Zoom** and **Cloud Recordings**

- The HTML link provides the (RevealJS) version of the slides that I suggest you focus on during class.
- The Word link will let you download the material in the slides as a Word (.docx) document.
    - Some people prefer this to the HTML version for live note-taking.
- The Quarto file link provides the code I used (in [Quarto](https://quarto.org/)) to build the slides. Hit the download button after clicking the link above if you want the `.qmd` file.
- To print RevealJS slides **to pdf**, [follow these instructions](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/presenting.html#print-to-pdf) using Google Chrome as your browser.
- We attempt to record **most** 431 classes via Zoom and post the recording to Canvas.
