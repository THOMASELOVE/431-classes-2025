## Announcements

1. [Lab 1](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-labs-2025/tree/main/lab1) is due Wednesday 2025-09-17 at Noon. As things stand, **all** assignments for this course are due on Wednesdays at noon. See the [Calendar](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2025/calendar.html) for the final word in all situations. Submit it to [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu/).

2. There is a [Minute Paper after Class 05](https://bit.ly/431-2025-minute-05), which will open **by class time**, and which is also due Wednesday 2025-09-17 at Noon.
    - Before you respond, be sure to see the "[One Last Thing](#one-last-thing)" section, below.

3. I fixed a couple of typographical errors that alert students let me know about in the [Class 04 Slides](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-classes-2025/tree/main/class04#todays-slides).
    - If you find such an error during class time, raise your hand and let us know so I can fix it, but outside of class, if you see something, please email me so I can give you a little class participation credit.

4. In [section 14 of our Syllabus](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-syllabus-2025/14_advice.html), I updated a broken link. Here's the repaired version:

> Most people are really bad at meetings, including Professor Love. In a series of tweets, Greg Wilson argued that "...the single most useful training you can give an adult is how to run a meeting and how to participate in someone else's." He then provides [some nice tips in this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f3-q9SzkeE).

5. There is a [new version of RStudio available](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) (2025.09.0 build 387 is the one I'm using now.) Feel encouraged to upgrade to this new version.

6. We will begin to post grades (and help you understand how to view and interpret them) after we've graded Lab 1.

7. Lab 2 is due a week from tomorrow, and I updated [the template for Lab 2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/THOMASELOVE/431-data/refs/heads/main/data/lab2-template.qmd) on our [431-data page](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-data) to include the `MKinfer` package, since I expect you'll want to use that package. The revised [Lab 2 template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/THOMASELOVE/431-data/refs/heads/main/data/lab2-template.qmd) now includes all packages that I used in preparing the Lab 2 answer sketch.

8. A [quick demonstration](demo_class05.qmd) about one difference between "live coding" and rendering data related to the use of `kable()` or `print_md()`.

## Ten More Interesting/Fun Facts about Students in this semester's 431 class
