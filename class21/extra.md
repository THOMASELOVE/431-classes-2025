# Looking for a little extra credit?

By Friday, 2025-11-21, three bonus opportunities will be published and available for you. All are due in the week following Thanksgiving Break, between December 2 and 4.

Two of those opportunities are "hidden" elsewhere, but one of them is right here.

Send Dr. Love an email by 9 AM on Wednesday 2025-12-03 (that's three hours before Quiz 2 is due) with the subject heading: **431 My Favorite R function**.
    - In the body of that email, answer the following...
    - What is your favorite R function, and why is it your favorite?
    - Two or three complete English sentences is a sufficient response.

That's it. Thanks and good luck.
