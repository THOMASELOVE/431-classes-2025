## Announcements

1. Feedback on the Minute Paper after Class 07 [is now available](https://bit.ly/431-2025-min-07-feedback).
2. The Answer Sketch for Lab 2 will be posted **WHEN** to our Shared Drive.
3. By now, you should have received your **431 Grading Code** in your CWRU email and should have used it to look up the feedback on Lab 1 we have provided on our Shared Drive. If you are having trouble using the code, contact me.
    - If you have questions about the Answer Sketch for any completed Lab, please address them to myself or the TAs at any time.
    - If you have questions about how many points you received on any question in any Lab, don't bother the TAs. Instead, [follow this link](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-labs-2025/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#lab-regrade-requests-will-be-reviewed-in-december) and fill out the [Lab Regrade Request Form](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-labs-2025/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#lab-regrade-requests-will-be-reviewed-in-december) before 2025-12-12.
4. I fixed the axis labels in slide 21 (also see the revised code in slide 20) on the comparison boxplot in the [Class 07 Slides](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-slides-2025/class07.html). I fixed the posted [Word version](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-slides-2025/class07w.docx) and [the posted Quarto code](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-slides-2025/blob/main/class07.qmd), too.

## Favorite Movies Discussion 1

For today's discussion, [we'll go to this link](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-classes-2025/blob/main/movies/class08.md).

The link above describes some information about the `movies_2025-09-25` Google Sheet now found in our Shared Google Drive. 

- That sheet describes the **51** movies selected as a "favorite movie" by students in 431 in the Fall 2025 version of this course.
    - On Tuesday, we'll be looking at a larger set of data, including "favorite movies" from students in 2020-2024, as well.
- In Class 07, I talked a little bit more about how I developed the data and variable descriptions and sources tabs in the sheet, mostly using [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/).
- In future classes (starting Tuesday), we'll augment this database in several ways, and we'll develop (and try to explore) some research questions.
- In addition to [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/), some other sites I have used in the past to gather data about movies include:
    - <https://www.rottentomatoes.com/>, <https://www.flickchart.com/> and <https://the-numbers.com/>
    - **In class 11, I will be looking for you to help me identify other available public sources of interesting movie data, so you might want to give that some thought in spare hours.**

## Reminders (see [the Calendar](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2025/calendar.html) for the final word on all deadlines)

    - Read *The Art of Statistics* by David Spiegelhalter, Chapter 7 (we'll read Chapter 6 later, you can read it now if you like)
    - Read [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/), sections 16 (Factors) and 28 (Quarto)
    - Remember that our class will be (at least partially) video-taped on Tuesday 2025-09-30.
