## Announcements

1. Feedback on the Minute Paper after Class 07 **will appear** in time for class.
2. The Answer Sketch for Lab 2 will be posted **WHEN** to our Shared Drive.
3. By now, you should have received your **431 Grading Code** in your CWRU email and should have used it to look up the feedback on Lab 1 we have provided on our Shared Drive. If you are having trouble using the code, contact me.
    - If you have questions about the Answer Sketch for any completed Lab, please address them to myself or the TAs at any time.
    - If you have questions about how many points you received on any question in any Lab, don't bother the TAs. Instead, [follow this link](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-labs-2025/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#lab-regrade-requests-will-be-reviewed-in-december) and fill out the [Lab Regrade Request Form](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-labs-2025/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#lab-regrade-requests-will-be-reviewed-in-december) before 2025-12-12.
4. I fixed the axis labels in slide 21 (also see the revised code in slide 20) on the comparison boxplot in the [Class 07 Slides](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-slides-2025/class07.html). I fixed the Word version and the code, too.

## Favorite Movies Discussion 1

Consider the `movies_2025-09-26` Google Sheet now found in our Shared Google Drive. 

- This file describes the **51** movies selected as a "favorite movie" by students in 431 in the Fall 2025 version of this course.
    - On Tuesday, we'll be looking at a larger set of data, including "favorite movies" from students in 2020-2024, as well.
    - Here is a convenient list of those 51 movies, just for today, and the variables included in the data, in case you can't see the Google Sheet live.
- Today, we'll talk a little bit more about how I developed the data and variable descriptions and sources tabs in the sheet, mostly using [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/).
- In future classes (starting Tuesday), we'll augment this database in several ways, and we'll develop (and try to explore) some research questions.
- In addition to [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/), some other sites I have used in the past to gather data about movies include:
    - <https://www.rottentomatoes.com/>, <https://www.flickchart.com/> and <https://the-numbers.com/>
    - In class 11, I will be looking for you to help me identify other sources of interesting movie data, so you might want to give that some thought in spare hours.
