## As you walk in...

Be sure to get one of the "A Convenient Piece of Paper" handouts. **Don't** write on it yet. Instead, get to know those around you.

## This is the README page for Class 01.

Each class' README serves as a starting point for that class session.
The main website for this class is <https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2025/>. From that site, get to this README by

- selecting **Calendar**
- then selecting today's class (Class 01).
- Direct Link to this page is: <https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-classes-2025/tree/main/class01>

## Today's Slides

Class | Date | Slides | Word .docx | Quarto .qmd | Recording
:---: | :--------: | :------: | :------: | :------: | :-------------:
01 | 2025-09-02 | **[Slides 01](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-slides-2025/class01.html)** | **[Word 01](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-slides-2025/class01w.docx)** | **[Code 01](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-slides-2025/blob/main/class01.qmd)** | Visit [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu/), select **Zoom** and **Cloud Recordings**

- The HTML link provides the (RevealJS) version of the slides that I suggest you focus on during class.
- The Word link will let you download the material in the slides as a Word (.docx) document.
    - Some people prefer this to the HTML version for live note-taking.
- The Quarto file link provides the code I used (in [Quarto](https://quarto.org/)) to build the slides. Hit the download button after clicking the link above if you want the `.qmd` file.
- To print RevealJS slides **to pdf**, [follow these instructions](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/presenting.html#print-to-pdf) using Google Chrome as your browser.
- We attempt to record **most** 431 classes via Zoom and post the recording to Canvas.
