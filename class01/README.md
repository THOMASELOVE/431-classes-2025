## As you walk in...

Be sure to get one of the "A Convenient Piece of Paper" handouts. **Don't** write on it yet. Instead, get to know those around you.

## This is the README page for Class 01.

Each class' README serves as a starting point for that class session.
The main website for this class is <https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2025/>. From that site, get to this README by

- selecting **Calendar**
- then selecting today's class (Class 01).

## Today's Slides

Class | Date | Slides | Word .docx | Quarto .qmd | Recording
:---: | :--------: | :------: | :------: | :------: | :-------------:
01 | 2025-09-02 | **[Slides 01](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-slides-2025/class01.html)** | **[Word 01](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-slides-2025/class01w.docx)** | **[Code 01](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-slides-2025/blob/main/class01.qmd)** | Visit [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu/), select **Zoom** and **Cloud Recordings**

- The HTML link provides the (RevealJS) version of the slides that I suggest you focus on during class.
- The Word link will let you download the material in the slides as a Word (.docx) document.
    - Some people prefer this to the HTML version for live note-taking.
- The Quarto file link provides the code I used (in [Quarto](https://quarto.org/)) to build the slides. Hit the download button after clicking the link above if you want the `.qmd` file.
- To print RevealJS slides **to pdf**, [follow these instructions](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/presenting.html#print-to-pdf) using Google Chrome as your browser.
- We attempt to record **most** 431 classes via Zoom and post the recording to Canvas.

## Announcements

If you are **not yet enrolled** in this class, please talk to me before you leave this room. We're basically full here, but there is a Section 2 of 431 from 4:00 - 5:15 on Tuesdays and Thursdays, if you're not planning on also taking 432 this Spring.

1. Make sure you have read the [Getting Started](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2025/#getting-started) materials on [the course website](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2025/).
2. Thanks to the 44 of you (when last I checked) who've already completed the [Welcome to 431 survey](https://bit.ly/431-2025-welcome). Remember this is due tomorrow (Wednesday 2025-09-03) at noon.
3. As part of our slides today, we'll visit [the main course page](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2025/) for the course, and look over:
    - the [Syllabus](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-syllabus-2025/) You'll also want to review [the Syllabus](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-syllabus-2025/) thoroughly. I'll know if you haven't in the next week.
    - the [Course Book](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-book/) (Foundations of Applied Statistics and R)
    - the [Course Calendar](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2025/calendar.html), which is the final word for all deadlines in this course
    - the [Assignments](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2025/assignments.html), including the Minute Papers, Labs, Quizzes, and Projects.
    - the information available on [getting R and R Studio](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2025/software.html#installing-r-and-r-studio) and some [R packages and data sets](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2025/software.html#installing-r-packages-and-datacode-for-431) installed on your computer. You will need administrator authority on your computer to get this done.
    - the [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu/) page for the course, which we use as a place to turn in some assignments, and as a place to store Zoom recordings of our classes.
6. TA Office Hours begin **tomorrow** (Wednesday 2025-09-03). All are held via Zoom, and you should just drop in whenever you have questions.
    - If you’ve spent 15 minutes working on something and are stuck, don’t keep working on it. **ASK FOR HELP.**
    - The schedule is available on our [Contact Us](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2025/contact.html) and [Calendar](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2025/calendar.html#ta-office-hours) pages, and the Zoom links are found in a document on our Shared Google Drive.
