## Announcements

1. We've set up a new way for you to contact us, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, starting at 1 PM today. Just email `431-help` at `case` dot `edu`, to simultaneously contact Dr. Love and all thirteen TAs, if you want to ask us a question of any kind. We will get back to you as soon as possible. I've added this information to our [Contact](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2025/contact.html#once-the-class-begins) and [Calendar](http://thomaselove.github.io/431-2025/calendar.html#getting-help) pages.
2. Thanks to an alert student who pointed out that the measurements of hand span on the [Day 2 survey](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-classes-2025/blob/main/class02/431_surveyhandout_1perstudent_2025-09-04.pdf) were not in inches, but rather centimeters.
3. Thanks to those of you who completed the [Minute Paper after Class 03](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-minute-2025) on time. Feedback can be found at <https://bit.ly/431-2025-min-03-feedback>, which links to the file on our Shared Google Drive, so you'll need to be logged into Google via CWRU to review the feedback.
