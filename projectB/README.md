# Project B Materials

## Schedule for Project B Presentations

The schedule will be [posted here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-classes-2025/blob/main/projectB/schedule.md) on Friday 2025-11-14.

## Registration Status

As each group's [Project B Registration Form](https://bit.ly/431-projB-registration-2025) is submitted, I will list the investigators below. 

### Non-NHANES Study Plans

#### Not Yet Approved

OK? | Investigator(s) | Data Source | S2 Outcome | S2 Key Predictor | Subjects
:--: | :--------------------------------: | :-----------------------------: | :-----------------: | :-----------------: | ----:
❓ | Fai Albuainain | [National Health Interview Survey](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhis/documentation/2024-nhis.html), 2024 Adult Sample | days missed work in past 12m | asthma episode/attack in past 12m | 1392
❓ | Dana Kleinman. | [National Health Interview Survey](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhis/documentation/2024-nhis.html), 2024 Adult Sample | # of diagnosed health conditions | cardiovascular physical activity (3 levels) | 1106

- ❓ Fai: (a) Does the count of 1392 subjects refer specifically to 1392 subjects with a diagnosis of asthma? (b) I want to see a tabyl of the outcome variable and the key predictor (2 levels) before I'll give final approval.
- ❓ Dana: Diagnosed health conditions is a count, which for most people in your sample of 1106 will be either 0, 1, or 2. We need more variation than that in an outcome for this project, so I am concerned. (b) I want to see a tabyl of the outcome variable and the key predictor (3 levels) within your sample before I'll give final approval.

Here is a simple footnote[^1].

### NHANES Study Plans

OK? | Investigator(s) | Survey Dates | S2 Outcome | S2 Key Predictor | Subjects
:--: | :--------------------------------: | :------------------: | :--------------------: | :--------------------: | ----:
✔️ | Cher Yuan | 8/2021 to 8/2023 | `BMXBMI` (Body Mass Index) | `DMDMARTZ` Marital Status (3 levels) | 5000

- Cher: (a) There are only three meaningful levels in your cardiovascular physical activity variable: levels 4 (Refused) and 5 (Don't Know) should be recoded as missing. (b) I assume your sample will be restricted to those with both a known `BMXBMI` and a `DMDMARTZ` in levels 1 (Married) 2 (No Longer Married) or 3 (Never Married). If that is correct, then I approve your project. If not, please contact me.
