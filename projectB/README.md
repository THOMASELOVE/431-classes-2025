# Project B Materials

## Schedule for Project B Presentations

The schedule will be [posted here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-classes-2025/blob/main/projectB/schedule.md) on Friday 2025-11-14.

## Registration Status

As each group's [Project B Registration Form](https://bit.ly/431-projB-registration-2025) is submitted, I will list the investigators below. 

### Important Notes

1. In the **OK?** column, below...
    - ✔️ means I have approved your plan, but check to see if I have a note (footnote) that you need to respond to. If there is a check and no footnote by your name, then you're all set. Go and do the rest of Project B.
    - ❓ means I might approve your plan, but the footnote will tell you what further information or clarification I need (and how you should send it) before I approve your work.
    - **NO** means I will not approve your plan as currently listed, and you will have to edit your Registration form and resubmit it according to the requirements in my note to you.
2. In general, I am not going to let students use the **431 Favorite Movies** data. Other students *might* be allowed to use them, but only with my emailed permission **before** you submit the Project B Registration Form. Contact me by email now if you want me to consider letting you use these data. You will need to make a strong case to me that you are going to do something of interest to me that does not overlap with other projects in order to use these data.
3. The count of complete cases we ask for is across **ALL** your variables to be used in Study 2, not just the outcome and key predictor. Be sure to get this right, including properly treating Refused and Don't Know as missing in all variables before making your count.
4. Anyone working with NHANES data should have an age restriction, either to **adults** (which can be ages 21-79 or 18-79 or some smaller group within that range) or **children** (which should be determined depending on how the data are gathered, and include only people under a certain age - and perhaps above one, too, like 6 to 17 years old, for example.)

### Non-NHANES Study Plans

OK? | Investigator(s) | Data Source | S2 Outcome | S2 Key Predictor | Subjects
:--: | :-------------------------------------: | :-----------------------------: | :-----------------: | :-----------------: | ----:
✔️ | Dana Kleinman | [National Health Interview Survey](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhis/documentation/2024-nhis.html), 2024 Adult Sample | average hours of sleep per night | cardiovascular physical activity (3 levels) | 1,074
✔️ | Fai Albuainain & Avianna Thompson | [National Health Interview Survey](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhis/documentation/2024-nhis.html), 2024 Adult Sample | days missed work  in past 12m | asthma episode/attack  in past 12m | 450
✔️  | Moses Fleischman | [Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System](https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/annual_2024.html), 2024 | Days in past 30 when mental health was not good | Adult made the respondent feel safe/protected during childhood (5 levels) | 10,000
✔️ | Phia Ribeiro & Annabelle Elsner Pacheco | 431 Favorite Movies data from 2025-10-28 | Awards received | Rotten Tomatoes Critic's Score | 250
**NO** | Noni Pinales[^Noni] & Swati Jha | [National Survey of Family Growth](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nsfg/nsfg-2022-2023-puf.htm), 2022-2023 - Female Respondent File | *needs to change* | lived with intact family from birth to age 18 (yes/no) | TBD
**NO** | Subin Lee[^Subin] | [National Hospital Care Survey](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhcs/data/index.html), 2021 | *needs to change* | *needs to change* |  TBD

[^Noni]: Noni and Swati: I will not allow you to use age at first marriage as an outcome, or any other "age" variable. You'll need a different quantitative outcome. Also, "refused" and "don't know" in your predictor must be treated as missing, changing your sample size, as will the change in outcome. Edit your form to address these comments, and then resubmit it.
[^Subin]: Subin: You suggest the data describe individual people (which I think is correct) but the Study 2 outcome you propose (in-hospital mortality) is binary if it is about individual people. You need a quantitative outcome in Study 2, not a categorical one. Also, your proposed key predictor is age, which you propose to categorize. Do not do this (at least not in Study 2.) You want a quantitative key predictor if at all possible, so age is fine, but not categorized. You will need to restrict your sample to adults, I think, so specify what that age range will be. So I cannot accept this, as you've planned it, and you'll need to try again to specify a proper quantitative outcome and key predictor, then identify the sample size again. Edit your form to address these comments, and then resubmit it.

### NHANES Study Plans

OK? | Investigator(s) | Survey Dates | S2 Outcome | S2 Key Predictor | Subjects
:--: | :-------------------------------------: | :------------------: | :--------------------: | :--------------------: | ----:
✔️ | Amanda Barabas | 8/2021 to 8/2023 | `LBXSATSI` Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) (IU/l) | Are products used in the home to control insects? (yes/no) | 6,366
✔️ | Ben Kwiatkowski | 8/2021 to 8/2023 | `SLD012` Weekday sleep hours | `KIQ481` Times per night waking to urinate (0-4 or 5+) | 4,843
✔️ | Lily Zhang | 8/2021 to 8/2023 | `SLD012` Weekday sleep hours | `PAD790Q` & `PAD790U` Times engaged in moderate leisure-time physical activity per week (4 groups) | 1,531
✔️ | Shufei Fang & <br> Ruoying Chen | 8/2021 to 8/2023 | `LBXTC` Total cholesterol (mg/dl) | `LBXWBCSI` White blood cell count (1000 cells / μl) | 1,994
✔️ | Cher Yuan[^Cher] | 8/2021 to 8/2023 | `BMXBMI` Body Mass Index | `DMDMARTZ` Marital Status (3 levels) | 5,000
✔️ | Valerie Lam[^Valerie] | 2017-3/2020 | `LBXIN` insulin (μU/mL) | `BMXHIP` hip circumference (cm) | 4,433


[^Cher]: Cher: (a) There are only three meaningful levels in your cardiovascular physical activity variable: levels 4 (Refused) and 5 (Don't Know) should be recoded as missing. (b) I assume your sample will be restricted to those with both a known `BMXBMI` and a `DMDMARTZ` in levels 1 (Married) 2 (No Longer Married) or 3 (Never Married). If that is correct, then let me know via email and I will then approve your project and remove this note. If not, please contact me via email to explain.
[^Valerie]: Valerie: I strongly encourage you to look at male subjects ages 18-79 or 21-79, rather than at any age. Please email me to let me know you've seen this and give me the revised number of subjects, so I can then remove this note.
