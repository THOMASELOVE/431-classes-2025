# Project B Materials

## Schedule for Project B Presentations

The schedule will be [posted here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-classes-2025/blob/main/projectB/schedule.md) on Friday 2025-11-14.

## Registration Status

As each group's [Project B Registration Form](https://bit.ly/431-projB-registration-2025) is submitted, I will list the investigators below. 

- The deadline for the form is Wednesday 2025-11-12 at noon. If you are more than 59 minutes late, you will be assigned to the schedule last and lose some credit on Project B.

### Important Notes

1. In the **OK?** column, below...
    - ✔️ means I have approved your plan, but check to see if I have a note (footnote) that you need to respond to. If there is a check and no footnote by your name, then you're all set. Go and do the rest of Project B.
    - ❓ means I am likely to approve your plan, but the footnote will tell you what further information or clarification I need (and how you should send it) before I formally approve your work.
    - **NO** means I will not approve your plan as currently listed, and you will have to edit your Registration form and resubmit it according to the requirements in my note to you.
2. In general, I am not going to let students use the **431 Favorite Movies** data. Other students *might* be allowed to use them, but only with my emailed permission **before** you submit the Project B Registration Form. Contact me by email now if you want me to consider letting you use these data. You will need to make a strong case to me that you are going to do something of interest to me that does not overlap with other projects in order to use these data.
3. The count of complete cases we ask for is across **ALL** your variables to be used in Study 2, not just the outcome and key predictor. Be sure to get this right, including properly treating Refused and Don't Know as missing in all variables before making your count.
4. Anyone working with NHANES data should have an age restriction, either to **adults** (which can be ages 21-79 or 18-79 or some smaller group within that range) or **children** (which should be determined depending on how the data are gathered, and include only people under a certain age - and perhaps above one, too, like 6 to 17 years old, for example.)
5. If you have more than the maximum allowable number of observations (10,000 for Non-NHANES studies, and 7,500 for NHANES studies), I encourage you to either (a) focus on a single sex (either females only or males only), or restrict the age range, or apply some other simply explained inclusion criterion that focuses your sample down below the maximum (maybe to about 4,000 subjects), or (b) *a less good solution* take a random sample of, say, 4,000 complete cases from your sample so that, again, you are well below the maximum possible sample size for your type of study.

#### Footnotes (and perhaps other issues) still to be resolved

OK? | Investigator(s) | Survey Dates | S2 Outcome | S2 Key Predictor | Subjects
:--: | :-------------------------------------: | :------------------: | :--------------------: | :--------------------: | ----:
❓ | Amjad Samara[^Amjad] | 8/2021 to 8/2023 | `LBDLDL` LDL cholesterol (mg/dl) | `BMXBMI` body mass index (kg/m2) | 3,192
❓ | Jiakun Wang[^Jiakun] | 2017 to 3/2020 | mean of `BPXOSY1`, `BPXOSY2`, `BPXOSY3` systolic blood pressure (mm Hg) | `BMXBMI` body mass index (kg/m2) | 7,007

[^Amjad]: Amjad: Use subjects with ages of 21-79, and not 80. Those with age 80 include and 80 and over, and I don't want them involved. Email me so I know you have seen this, so I can correct the size above and then remove this note.
[^Jiakun]: Jiakun: Either (a) take a random sample of 4,000 of these subjects between the ages of 21 and 79 for your Project B, please, or, if you prefer, (b) focus on a single sex, or a smaller age range, or some other inclusion criterion that focuses your sample on less than 4,000 subjects. Personally, I would prefer you to choose option (b). Please email me to let me know you've seen this and what you will do, so I can correct the size above and then remove this note.
[^Jiayi]: Jiayi: How many of the 549 children between the ages of 4 and 19 you have identified have a value of 5 in `INDFMPIR`. I am worried the fraction will be very large. Send me an email with this information so I can think more about whether this is going to work as a key predictor.
