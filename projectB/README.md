# Project B Materials

## Schedule for Project B Presentations

The schedule will be [posted here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-classes-2025/blob/main/projectB/schedule.md) on Friday 2025-11-14.

## Registration Status

As each group's [Project B Registration Form](https://bit.ly/431-projB-registration-2025) is submitted, I will list the investigators below. 

- The deadline for the form is Wednesday 2025-11-12 at noon. If you are more than 59 minutes late, you will be assigned to the schedule last and lose some credit on Project B.

### Important Notes

1. In the **OK?** column, below...
    - ✔️ means I have approved your plan, but check to see if I have a note (footnote) that you need to respond to. If there is a check and no footnote by your name, then you're all set. Go and do the rest of Project B.
    - ❓ means I might approve your plan, but the footnote will tell you what further information or clarification I need (and how you should send it) before I approve your work.
    - **NO** means I will not approve your plan as currently listed, and you will have to edit your Registration form and resubmit it according to the requirements in my note to you.
2. In general, I am not going to let students use the **431 Favorite Movies** data. Other students *might* be allowed to use them, but only with my emailed permission **before** you submit the Project B Registration Form. Contact me by email now if you want me to consider letting you use these data. You will need to make a strong case to me that you are going to do something of interest to me that does not overlap with other projects in order to use these data.
3. The count of complete cases we ask for is across **ALL** your variables to be used in Study 2, not just the outcome and key predictor. Be sure to get this right, including properly treating Refused and Don't Know as missing in all variables before making your count.
4. Anyone working with NHANES data should have an age restriction, either to **adults** (which can be ages 21-79 or 18-79 or some smaller group within that range) or **children** (which should be determined depending on how the data are gathered, and include only people under a certain age - and perhaps above one, too, like 6 to 17 years old, for example.)

### Non-NHANES Study Plans

OK? | Investigator(s) | Data Source | S2 Outcome | S2 Key Predictor | Subjects
:--: | :-------------------------------------: | :-----------------------------: | :-----------------: | :-----------------: | ----:

✔️ | Moses Fleischman | [Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System](https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/annual_2024.html), 2024 | Days in past 30 when mental health was not good | Adult made the respondent feel safe/protected during childhood (5 levels) | 10,000
✔️ | Phia Ribeiro & Annabelle Elsner Pacheco | 431 Favorite Movies data from 2025-10-28 | Awards received | Rotten Tomatoes Critic's Score | 250
✔️ | Subin Lee[^Subin] | [2025 Annual Social and Economic Supplements Data](https://www.census.gov/data/datasets/time-series/demo/cps/cps-asec.html) | Total medical out-of-pocket expenditure (in dollars) | Total family earnings (in dollars) |  1,354
**NO** | Noni Pinales[^Noni] & Swati Jha | [National Survey of Family Growth](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nsfg/nsfg-2022-2023-puf.htm), 2022-2023 - Female Respondent File | *needs to change* | lived with intact family from birth to age 18 (yes/no) | TBD

[^Subin]: Subin: I will accept this plan, but want you to email me to let me know what year the data in your key outcome and key predictor describe. Is it 2024, or something else? It cannot be 2025, of course. So please email me that information, and I will then remove the footnote.
[^Noni]: Noni and Swati: I will not allow you to use age at first marriage as an outcome, or any other "age" variable. You'll need a different quantitative outcome. Also, "refused" and "don't know" in your predictor must be treated as missing, changing your sample size, as will the change in outcome. Edit your form to address these comments, and then resubmit it.
