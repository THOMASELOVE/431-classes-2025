# Project B Schedule of Project Presentations

- Email Dr. Love as soon as possible if...
  - you have questions about this schedule,
  - or you have an emergency on your presentation day.
- Join the [Zoom](#zoom-presentations) call at the **Arrival Time** listed below. 
  - We'll start as close to your Arrival Time as we can, and your actual presentation time is 20 minutes.
  - As noted, the Finish Time values are approximate.
- There is a document on our Shared Drive called **431 Project B Presentations: Description and Advice**, which I hope is useful.
- The **431 Project B Presentation Zoom Links** document also on our Shared Drive provides Zoom links for every presentation time, even those planned as In Person, in case of emergency.

# All remaining presentations this semester will be given over Zoom.

## Zoom Presentations
The Zoom link for your presentation time is found on **our Shared Drive** in the **431 Project B Presentation Zoom Links** document.

1. Join the Zoom at the **Arrival Time** listed for your project. You may be placed in a waiting room. I will let you in when I am ready for you.
2. Join the Zoom from a quiet location with good internet coverage using a computer which allows you to open the camera so that I can see you, and also has a decent microphone so I can hear you easily and decent speakers so that you can hear me easily.
3. Be ready to share (as necessary) both your HTML reports (for Study 1 and Study 2) and your slides for the presentation, so you can bring either one up easily.
4. Please feel encouraged to have a pencil/pen and some paper, so you can take notes on issues I bring up.
5. If you are working with a partner, one of you will share from a single computer for both studies, even while the other one is talking.
6. If you have a partner, I will randomly determine who will present Study 1, and who will present Study 2 at the time of your presentation. Be ready to present either study at a moment's notice.
7. Before you leave the Zoom call, you will have a good understanding from me of both how you did, and what you should do to improve your work in time for the final portfolio report (due 2025-12-10 at noon.)
8. After you complete the presentation, please remember to complete CWRU's Course Evaluation Form for 431.

## In Person Presentations

In person presentations will be given in my office in **room WG-82J** at the extreme East end of the WG-82 Suite on the Ground Floor of the Wood Building[^Wood] at the CWRU School of Medicine. 

1. Arrive at my office (Wood WG-82J) at the **Arrival Time** listed for your study.
2. If the door is open when you arrive at Wood WG-82J, please come in. If the door is closed, please *don't knock*. Just wait nearby and I will open the door as soon as I can.
3. Come to the presentation with a charged laptop (although you will be able to plug it in if that's crucial) which has both your HTML and your slides for the presentation, so you can pull them up easily.
4. You are welcome to use notes related to your presentation so you can stay on track, if that's helpful to you.
5. Please feel encouraged to have a pencil/pen and some paper, so you can take notes on issues I bring up.
6. If you are working with a partner, I will randomly determine who will present Study 1, and who will present Study 2 at the time of your presentation. Be ready to present either study at a moment's notice.
7. Before you leave my office, you will have a good understanding from me of both how you did, and what you should do to improve your work in time for the final portfolio report (due 2025-12-10 at noon.)
8. After you leave my office, please remember to complete CWRU's Course Evaluation Form for 431.
  
[^Wood]: The Wood building is next to the Robbins building, which contains our classroom. If you need help getting to my office, let me know, and I'll show you the way from our classroom.
