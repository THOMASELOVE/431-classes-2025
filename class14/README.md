## Today's First Activity

We'll watch [So, What's A P-Value?](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1014409165269579) at the start of class today, I hope. 

This video was originally part of [Not Even Scientists Can Easily Explain P-values](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/not-even-scientists-can-easily-explain-p-values/) published 2015-11-24 by Christie Aschwanden at the now-dead 538 website. Here's the start of that piece:

> P-values have taken quite a beating lately. These widely used and commonly misapplied statistics have been blamed for giving a [veneer of legitimacy to dodgy study results](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ignore-the-headlines-we-dont-know-if-e-cigs-lead-kids-to-real-cigs/), encouraging [bad research practices](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/science-isnt-broken/#part2) and promoting [false-positive study results](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/psychology-is-starting-to-deal-with-its-replication-problem/).

> But after writing about p-values again and again, and recently issuing a correction on a [nearly year-old story](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/we-may-never-know-how-well-cloud-seeding-works/) over some erroneous information regarding a study's p-value (which I’d taken from the scientists themselves and their report, I’ve come to think that the most fundamental problem with p-values is that no one can really say what they are.

> Last week, I attended the inaugural [METRICS conference at Stanford](http://metrics.stanford.edu/), which brought together some of the world’s leading experts on meta-science, or the study of studies. I figured that if anyone could explain p-values in plain English, these folks could. I was wrong.

## Favorite Movies Survey

I have posted a "[Favorite Movies Survey](https://bit.ly/431-2025-movies-survey)". This (admittedly tedious) survey is required of all 431 students, and you will receive a couple of points of class participation credit for completing it. There are five questions, each with about 10 movies listed. Please complete this survey before **10 AM on Friday 2025-10-24**.
