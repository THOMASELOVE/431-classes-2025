## Some Other Things To Look At Over Break

1. Alex Reinhart's book [Statistics Done Wrong](https://www.statisticsdonewrong.com/index.html) is well worth your time.
2. Need some motivation to work with public health data and don't mind that the subject matter is horribly depressing? Here's the [Gun Violence Archive](https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/).
3. Looking for a video to watch over the break? Check out the work of [David Robinson](https://www.youtube.com/@safe4democracy), [Frank Harrell](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-o_ZZ0tuFUYn8e8rf-QURA) or [Julia Silge](https://www.youtube.com/@JuliaSilge).
    - One good option is David's [Tidy Tuesday screencast: analyzing student/teacher ratios and other country statistics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NoUHdrailxA)
    - Another is Julia's [Resampling to understand gender in art history textbooks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac7V848uBuo) with this [accompanying blog post](https://juliasilge.com/blog/art-history/).
4. Need a break? Perhaps you'll enjoy these [10 GIFs for Stats/Data People](https://graphpaperdiaries.com/2017/03/15/7-gifs-for-statsdata-people/) from BS King.

## One "Last Thing" in the middle of class

Frank Harrell posted this [Biostatistical Modeling Plan](https://hbiostat.org/blog/post/modplan/), most recently on 2023-01-26. This is the kind of thing we will work towards in 432.

> This is an example statistical plan for project proposals where the goal is to develop a biostatistical model for prediction, and to do external or strong internal validation of the model.

## Ten of the Most Important Ideas from 431 (discussed in today's slides)

1. You have to visualize and count data to understand it.
2. 90% of statistical work could be described as data management.
3. Quarto and the tidyverse make it easier to do the right thing.
4. Statistical significance is not a helpful concept.
5. Point estimates and confidence intervals are useful ideas.
6. Most statistical procedures are in fact regression models.
7. All statistical methods involve assumptions worth checking.
8. The bootstrap is a very useful, and somewhat underused tool.
9. Prediction models need to predict well in new situations.
10. Statistical thinking is far too important to be left to statisticians.
