## Announcements

1. On 2025-10-24, I sent everyone an email entitled *431: Using Transformations in Project A Analysis 1: Section 13 of the Portfolio Report, with a Bonus Tip (highlighted below)*. Here's the tip:
    - *Something not in the instructions that we encourage you to consider doing for some extra credit*: If, after doing these checks, you decide to use your model to make a couple of predictions, perhaps **for two counties of interest to you**, which is generally a good idea in Section 13.3 and often is helpful in describing your Analysis 1 results in an interesting way in your video presentation, and you've used a transformation, then build predictions using this transformed model, and then back-transform the predictions and not the regression model coefficients to the scale of the original outcome, Y and  interpret the results.
2. On 2025-10-25, I adjusted [the Lab 5 instructions](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-labs-2025/tree/main/lab5) very slightly on 2025-10-25 to add a couple of necessary packages (`Epi` and either `MKinfer` or `infer`.)
3. Results from the [small movies survey](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-classes-2025/blob/main/movies/small_survey.md) (Yes/No/Unsure) for the 51 movies listed as "favorite" this year [are now available](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-classes-2025/blob/main/movies/small_survey.md).
4. A new (possibly final) [version of the favorite movies data](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-classes-2025/tree/main/movies#the-current-version-of-the-data-is-movies_2025-10-28), called `movies_2025-10-28`, is available on our Shared Drive.
5. There is a Minute Paper after Class 16, due tomorrow (Wednesday 2025-10-29). The link will be **provided soon**.
