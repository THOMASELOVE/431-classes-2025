# Feedback on your Questions and Comments from the Project A Self-Evaluation

## Your Comments/Questions, My Responses

1. I am enjoying the class, I feel both engaged and challenged!
    - That's great to hear.
2. I am tired.
    - I am not surprised. It was a rough time there, but we're getting into the flow a little better now.
3. I appreciate the learning experiences from this project.
    - Thank you!
4. I appreciated the option for extra credit code that was announced this week. However, by that point I was tired of looking at the quarto file and didn't bother. If possible, announcing extra credit sooner would be awesome.
    - But it takes away the "extra" part a bit, in my mind.
    - Also, I thought of it on the spur of the moment - it wasn't planned, unlike most things in the class.
5. I appreciated the structured format of Project A, and the way that it was paired with some freedom to choose and complete analysis that may have been more interesting or relevant for each student.
    - Thank you!
6. I did not feel confident presenting my data in the video. Not only did it take a while for me to work my explanation down to the right time frame, but I also just was unsure exactly what I wanted to say. I look forward to learning how to more effectively report my results.
    - I hope some of our feedback is helpful. 
7. I don't have anything specific to say about the course. It's hard but I'm learning a lot.
    - I am willing to accept that compromise - that "drinking from a fire hose" feeling should pay off as we move forward a bit. 
8. I enjoyed Project A and found it a good learning experience, especially in applying statistical concepts to real-world data. The detailed guidance throughout the 431 course helped build practical and new skills. I wish there was more flexibility in certain details that has little impact on the big picture.
    - Some details are more important than others, but (1) this is the world, and (2) we need some consistency in order to give the kind of feedback you'll receive on a tight schedule without murdering myself and the TAs. 
9. I want to say that this project was genuinely challenging for me. There were many moments when I felt lost and didn't know how to proceed, especially when debugging code or interpreting complex statistical concepts. However, I'm grateful I was able to push through and complete it.
    - Me, too.
10. I would like to know how much time other students spend on each lab or project. As English is my second language, I don’t expect to spend the same amount of time as native speakers, but I want to know whether it is normal to spend so many hours on an assignment.
    - I understand, and included some information on this in the [feedback on the Minute Paper after Class 18](https://bit.ly/431-2025-min-18-feedback).
    - Sometimes, I would rather be interesting than normal, but I see why you care about this.
11. I'm struggling to keep up and I'm not sure what to do to start turning it around.
    - This is a real challenge. It's an easy course to feel like you're falling behind in. Come talk to me, if you want to.
12. I'm worried about this project since we did horribly on the plan :(
    - No one did *horribly* on the plan.
13. Please say thank you to all the TAs for helping me out in so many nights and answering my multiple questions.
    - I will, but also, a comment to 431-help at case dot edu will get to the inbox of all of the TAs.
14. Sometimes I can't keep up and would like to know if I submit an incomplete assignment, would it be completely rejected?
    - For a Lab, we'd certainly accept and see where you were. We also accept late Labs up to 48 hours after the deadline, with some penalty.
    - For Project B and Quiz 2, we need you to meet the deadlines so we can provide grades (and feedback for the Quiz) on CWRU's schedule.
15. Thanks
    - You're welcome.
16. The effort you (Dr. Love) put into the course has resulted in a lot of learning in me, so thank you.
    - That's great. You're welcome.
17. The feedback from Dr. Love and the TA office sessions were very helpful. TA even followed up with me to answer my question I had that she couldn't answer during the session which I appreciated.
    - Oh great! Thanks.
18. The Project A was a lot to go through, but I also learned a lot and gauged my understanding a bit better. Thank you for the opportunity!
    - It was a pleasure.
19. The skills learned in completing this project will certainly be useful in my career!
    - That is great to hear!
20. Wonderful opportunity to learn how to deliver results. However, I don't enjoy the videos.
    - Not many people do. It is the hardest part, I would argue. The good news is that you won't make one again in 431 for me.
21. Would you consider offering a group option for project B?
    - In Project B, you can also work with a partner. I don't allow more than two people per group.
