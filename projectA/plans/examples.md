## Reminder about the Review Elements List from 2024 that I provided

The [review elements list in the Project A Plan](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectA-2025/plan.html#checklist-review-elements-for-the-project-a-plan) specifically mentions (twice) that it refers to **2024**, and not 2025, and I also mentioned this in class. Yours will be similar but not identical, naturally. For example, you should be using R 4.5.1. and your dates should be something like 2025-10-01, etc.

## General Advice on Titles

Titles are difficult to build, but are also very important, and I'd like to see your work start out as effectively as possible. I believe that each of you can create a more effective title (which meets the maximum 80 characters limit) and subtitle (which should not exceed 150 characters) than you have submitted, so I'll expect a new title and subtitle when you submit the Project A Portfolio. A few tips (which you will also find in our feedback, coming early next week.)

1. Your title needs to distinguish your project well from the other 44 project A submissions.
2. A good strategy is to focus on one of your research questions in which you think your readers can be enticed (in a brief title of no more than 80 characters) to be actively interested in your results. This may be easier when you have completed your analyses in the portfolio.
3. Information like the fact that you're using data from CHR 2025 (and CHR 2019) in your work or that you are using six states, or which six states they are can all be safely moved to a subtitle.
4. Avoid the use of words like "Exploring" or "Assessing how" or "An Analysis of" or "A Study of" or "Relationships between" or "Associations between" or "Correlations between" or "Impact of" or any other "throat clearing" phrases[^1] that don't actually communicate any meaningful information in your title or subtitle. They don't belong.
