## Ten More Interesting/Fun Facts about Students in this semester's 431 class

1. I love to workout and I have my personal training and barre certification!
2. I moved to Cleveland a month ago and already got 5 stitches :))
3. I name my pets after [cnidarians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cnidaria)
4. I recently started brewing my own kombucha
5. I somehow manage to run cancer research projects, study for Step exams, and raise a Boston Terrier puppy who thinks sheâ€™s my boss. Honestly, the puppy is the toughest project.
6. I started skiing when I was 2 and a half years old.
7. I studied in Ireland for a semester in undergrad.
8. I used to practice aerial dancing.
9. I was on CWRUbotix's product demo team for the MATE ROV (underwater drone) World Championship a couple of months ago when we won first overall in the university class.
10. I work at Case, primarily dissecting fresh cadavers.

These come from the Welcome to 431 survey - some more results from that survey [can be found here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-classes-2025/blob/main/class02/welcome_report.md).
