## Announcements

1. I have completed the document on [How the Project A Plans Were Evaluated](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-classes-2025/blob/main/projectA/plans/evaluation.md).
2. More to come.

## On Sample Size Requirements for Estimating and Comparing Proportions

- When you are trying to build an estimate of a single population proportion based on a sample, a minimum requirement on np and n(1-p) of 5, or even 10, is important for the confidence intervals generated by `prop.test()` and the other methods I demonstrated in Class 11 make sense.Â  The Agresti-Coull and `saifs_ci()` approaches still do reasonably well if both np and n(1-p) are at least 5.
  - If you have less than 5 observations of either "yes" or "no" and want to estimate the proportion of "yes" responses in a population, your interval won't be very good, no matter what method you use, and I would ask why you'd be trying to do statistical inference in that setting anyway.
- For a 2x2 table, we use `twoby2()` from Epi or `twobytwo()` from `Love-431.R` regardless of sample size to get tentative results, but the assumption of a 2x2 table is that you have a reasonable sample size (10 is a better minimum than 5 there) in each cell.
  - If you don't have at least 10 observations in each cell, no statistical method will be accurate (the Fisher exact test, for example, isn't better than the Pearson chi-square (asymptotic) test), and I would ask why you'd be trying to do statistical inference in that setting anyway.

## Favorite Movies

Here is our [Class 12 activity](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-classes-2025/blob/main/movies/class12.md), which we introduced in Class 11.

Also, I remind you that: A Favorite Movies Update (including analyses of questions posed in Class 09) is now available as [Quarto](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/THOMASELOVE/431-classes-2025/refs/heads/main/movies/movies_update1.qmd) or [HTML](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-classes-2025/blob/main/movies/movies_update1.html) **for download**. You'll also find these files on our Shared Drive as `movies_update1.qmd` and `movies_update1.html`.
