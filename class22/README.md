## Announcements

1. Today's Data Source is [NHANES 2013-14](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/default.aspx?BeginYear=2013)
2. The [Project B Presentation Schedule is here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-classes-2025/blob/main/projectB/schedule.md).
3. [Creating simulated data sets in R](https://stirlingcodingclub.github.io/simulating_data/index.html) by Brad Duthie might be of some interest to you who wonder how I simulate class examples from existing real data. This isn't exactly what I do (among other things, I use the tidyverse more) but it's close and more generally applicable than my method.
4. More to come.

## Reminders

## Taking Other Courses With Me

In addition to 431, I teach two other semester-long courses, called **PQHS 432** and **PQHS 500**. I will teach both 432 and 500 in Spring 2026. My advice on these courses is found [in the Class 18 README](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-classes-2025/tree/main/class18#taking-other-courses-with-me).
