## Announcements

1. The final Minute Paper of 2025 is due Wednesday 2025-11-19 at noon and [can be found here](https://bit.ly/431-2025-minute-22).
2. **Lab 6 instructions** Lab 6 is also due tomorrow (2025-11-19) at noon. You should have received news last Thursday that we (slightly) changed the [Lab 6 instructions](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-labs-2025/tree/main/lab6), to add to the data cleaning the process of making the subjects whose `ejec_frac` was listed as 0 into NA values.
    - Please make sure you are using the current version (dated 2025-11-13) of the instructions.
    - The [PDF linked here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-labs-2025/blob/main/lab6/431-lab6.pdf) and sent to your email last Thursday indicates the changes (all on page 4 of the instructions) with yellow highlighting.
4. **Project B** As a reminder, the [Project B Presentation Schedule is here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-classes-2025/blob/main/projectB/schedule.md). Let me know via email if you have questions.
5. **Quiz 2** Complete [Quiz 2](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-quizzes-2025/tree/main/quiz2) materials will be posted by 3 PM on Thursday 2025-11-20.
6. [Creating simulated data sets in R](https://stirlingcodingclub.github.io/simulating_data/index.html) by Brad Duthie might be of some interest to you who wonder how I simulate class examples from existing real data. This isn't exactly what I do (among other things, I use the tidyverse more) but it's close and more generally applicable than my method.
7. Today's Data Source is [NHANES 2013-14](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/default.aspx?BeginYear=2013)

### Thanksgiving Break means no class next week

1. **WARNING!** I will be away for a week during the break! I will check my email every day through Saturday 2025-11-22 **and then not again until** Sunday 2025-11-30. So from Sunday 2025-11-23 through Saturday 2025-11-29, your emailed questions about the Quiz will simply await my return.
2. TA Office hours are **canceled** from Saturday 2025-11-22 through Friday 2025-11-28 for the break.

## Reminders

## Taking Other Courses With Me

In addition to 431, I teach two other semester-long courses, called **PQHS 432** and **PQHS 500**. I will teach both 432 and 500 in Spring 2026. My advice on these courses is found [in the Class 18 README](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-classes-2025/tree/main/class18#taking-other-courses-with-me).
