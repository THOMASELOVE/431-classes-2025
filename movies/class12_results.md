### Notes

[^1]: Here is a [video explaining the Bechdel-Wallace test](https://feministfrequency.com/video/the-bechdel-test-for-women-in-movies/). Bechdel-Wallace scores range from 0 to 3, and are a count of how many of these standards are met by the movie: 1. It has to have at least two named women in it. 2. Who talk to each other 3. About something besides a man. A passing score is 3, anything less doesn't pass the test.

[^2]: We plan to exclude TV shows, and movies where the question "Does the dog die?" have no values. If the question has more Yes than No then we consider it as a Yes, and if there are more No answer than Yes, we will consider No as the answer to the question. If there are No dogs then we will exclude the movie.

[^3]: A movieâ€™s overall CinemaScore can range from A+ to F, but we plan to collapse + and - into one letter category to reduce the number of levels.

[^4]: The "Production Method" falls into one of the following seven categories, it seems: Live Action, Animation/Live Action, Digital Animation, Hand Animation, Stop-Motion Animation, Multiple Production Methods, Rotoscoping.
